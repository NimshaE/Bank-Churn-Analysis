# Bank-Churn-Analysis
This group project focuses on predicting customer churn in the banking sector using machine learning and data analytics. By analyzing key factors such as credit score, account balance, tenure, number of products, and customer activity, the model identifies patterns that indicate whether a customer is likely to leave the bank.

Using techniques like logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks, the analysis helps banks take proactive measures to improve customer retention, personalize services, and enhance overall customer satisfaction. The insights gained enable data-driven decision-making to reduce churn and optimize business strategies.
